# Microsoft Graph connectors for Microsoft Search

## What is a Graph connector?

Microsoft Graph connectors are APIs that allow you to deliver data external to the Microsoft cloud into Microsoft Graph services and applications, to enhance Microsoft 365 experiences such as Microsoft Search.

This guide is an introduction to Microsoft Graph connectors for application developers. It provides guidance and direction to start building new Graph connectors for Microsoft Search, bring your own data, and take advantage of the available insights and analytics.

## Why building a Graph connector?

Microsoft Graph connectors integrate all your enterprise information in a single place. Graph connectors offer a simple and intuitive way to bring content from third-party or external sources into Microsoft Graph, enabling intelligent experiences. The most critical one being Search.
You can make your external data searchable in all the endpoints that Microsoft Search analyzes.
For example, you can use indexing APIs to build your own connectors or search APIs to query content from your custom search portals or apps.
